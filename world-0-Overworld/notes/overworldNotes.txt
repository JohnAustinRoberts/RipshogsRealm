The general idea behind the over-world is that of a giant hamster wheel divided into 6 sections. The should also be a central circular section with a rotating entrance surrounding a fixed platform.
On this fixed platform should be a door that the player first enters the 'puzzlebox' world through, and also where they respawn after death.
Each of the 6 sections should have a mural depicting what type of world is hidden beneath the trapdoors of each section. 
Once the player selects a world to enter, and goes through the trap door, the world will be set up in a very similar fashion.
It should also function as a hamseter wheel with 6 sections and a middle door. the 6 sections should represent the first 4 platforming levels, and the boss level, as well as an exit door.
the floating door in the middle of each world room will be the bonus door which is unlocked after collecting all of the bonus coins in a world.
